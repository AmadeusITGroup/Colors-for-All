## Features

You can perform the following actions for each palette :

- create
- edit
- duplicate
- delete
- save locally

There is no limit in the number of colors for each palette.

The application generates automatically a matrix (same colors horizontally and vertically) from this palette. Each cell of the matrix is the combination between 2 colors (foreground/background). The ratio and WCAG level is automatically computed and displayed for each combination. All accessible combinations (AA or AAA) are visually highlighted.

Thanks to this tool, you can wisely choose the best combinations of colors (foreground/background) to use in your own projects. This helps you design more “accessible” products.
